# CS4348 - Project 2: Bank Simulation

This project simulates a bank with 3 Tellers and 50 Customers using Python's `threading` module. The primary goal is to manage thread synchronization using semaphores and other coordination primitives.

## Files in this Repository

* `bank_sim.py`: This is the main, single-application file containing the entire simulation. It includes the thread functions for Tellers and Customers, all semaphores, and the main logic to run the simulation.
* `devlog.md`: The development log, maintained as required by the project instructions, documenting the planning and implementation process.

## How to Compile and Run

To run the program, simply execute the following command from your terminal:
python bank_sim.py
